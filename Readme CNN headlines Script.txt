# CNN Headline Scraper

This Python script fetches the latest headlines from the CNN website using web scraping techniques. It uses the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML content and extract the headline data.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- BeautifulSoup library (`pip install beautifulsoup4`)
- Requests library (`pip install requests`)

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the `cnn_headlines.py` script using Python:

python cnn_headlines.py


4. The script will fetch the latest headlines from CNN and display them in the console.

## Customization

- If you want to scrape headlines from a different news website, you can modify the `url` variable in the script to the desired website's URL.

- You can also extend the script to perform additional processing on the scraped data, such as saving it to a file or integrating it with other applications.

## Notes

- Web scraping can be subject to the terms and conditions of the website being scraped. Make sure to review and comply with any relevant legal and ethical considerations.

- This script relies on the HTML structure of the CNN website for extracting headlines. If CNN modifies their HTML structure, the script may require adjustments.
